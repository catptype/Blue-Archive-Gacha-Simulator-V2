## ‚ú® Features

This project goes beyond a simple gacha puller and implements a full suite of features found in modern web applications and games:

*   **Realistic Gacha Simulation:**
    *   Pull for students on different banners, each with unique rates and pickup characters.
    *   A high-impact, multi-stage "Prismatic Burst" animation for revealing rare (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ) students, complete with foil shines and sparkle effects.
    *   Separate, secure API endpoints for single and multi-pulls.
    *   Full support for guest users (pulls are not saved).

*   **Dynamic User Dashboard:**
    *   A fully asynchronous, widget-based dashboard that loads data without page reloads.
    *   **KPI Widgets:** At-a-glance stats for total pulls, Pyroxene spent, and rarity breakdowns.
    *   **"Hall of Fame" Podium:** An interactive, tabbed widget showcasing the top 3 most-pulled students for each rarity in a dynamic podium layout.
    *   **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts (Doughnut, Bar) powered by Chart.js to visualize overall pull history and per-banner statistics.
    *   **In-Depth Analysis:** Detailed performance tables with per-banner luck variance and 3-star pull gap analysis.
    *   **Milestone Timeline:** A unique, responsive horizontal timeline that visually charts the user's journey of obtaining their first ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ students.

*   **Comprehensive Student Collection:**
    *   View all students in the game, grouped by rarity.
    *   Obtained students are highlighted, while un-obtained students are shown with a "locked" overlay.
    *   Includes a client-side filtering system to view "All," "Obtained," or "Not Obtained" students instantly.

*   **Achievement & Progression System:**
    *   A complete backend service for checking and awarding achievements.
    *   **Collection Achievements:** Awarded for completing sets of students (e.g., "Collect all of the Abydos Task Force").
    *   **Milestone Achievements:** Awarded for reaching pull count milestones (10, 100, 1000 pulls).
    *   **Feats of Luck Achievements:** Special awards for rare events, like getting multiple 3-star students in a single 10-pull.
    *   **Toast Notifications:** Unlocked achievements appear as non-intrusive "toast" popups on the screen in real-time.

*   **Full User Authentication:**
    *   Secure user registration and login system powered by Django's built-in auth.
    *   All gacha history, inventory, and achievements are tied to the user account.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project can be run in two ways: directly from the source code (recommended for development) or with Docker Compose (recommended for a quick and consistent setup).

### Environment Configuration

This project is configured using environment variables in [settings.py](Blue_Archive_Gacha_Simulator/settings.py).<br>
For local development, **no configuration is needed.** The defaults are pre-configured to use a local `db.sqlite3` file and run in `DEBUG` mode.

---

### Method 1: Running from Source Code

This method gives you a direct development environment on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository** and `cd` into it.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/catptype/Blue-Archive-Gacha-Simulator-V2.git
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment** using your preferred tool (e.g., `venv`, `conda`).
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Initialize the database:**
    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py unpack
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000/`.

---

### Method 2: Running with Docker Compose (Easy Setup)

This method runs the entire application inside a container. The `Dockerfile` is configured to automatically handle all setup steps.

1.  **Clone the repository** and `cd` into it.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/catptype/Blue-Archive-Gacha-Simulator-V2.git
    ```

2.  **Build and start the application:**
    This single command will build the Docker image and start the web service in the background.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

3.  **Done!**
    The application is now fully initialized and available at `http://localhost:8000/`.

    > **Note:** The `Dockerfile` is configured to automatically run database migrations, unpack all initial data, and create a default superuser (`admin`/`1234`) during the image build process. **No manual setup commands are required.**
